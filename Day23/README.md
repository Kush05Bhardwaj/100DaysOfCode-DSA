## ✅ Problems Solved
| Problem | LeetCode # | Description |
|:--|:--:|:--|
| [Is Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/) | #392 | Check whether string `s` is a subsequence of string `t` by scanning characters in order. |

---

## 💡 Concepts Practiced
- Implemented the **two-pointer technique** for ordered subsequence matching  
- Incremented subsequence pointer only when characters match  
- Scanned through the second string (`t`) in a single pass  
- Achieved **O(n + m)** time and **O(1)** extra space  
- Strengthened understanding of **sequence preservation**, **pointer control**, and **string traversal**
