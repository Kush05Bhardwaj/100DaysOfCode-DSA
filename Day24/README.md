**📅 Date:** November 19, 2025  
**💻 Language:** Java  
**📚 Topic:** Frequency Counting & Palindrome Construction

## ✅ Problems Solved
| Problem | LeetCode # | Description |
|:--|:--:|:--|
| [Longest Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindrome/) | #409 | Find the maximum length of a palindrome that can be built using the characters of the given string. |

---

## 💡 Concepts Practiced
- Used a **HashMap** to track the frequency of each character  
- Maintained a counter for **odd occurrences**  
- Understood that:  
  - All **even counts** can be fully used  
  - For characters with **odd counts**, we can use their `count - 1`  
  - Only **one odd** frequency can be placed in the middle  
- Implemented logic to compute valid palindrome length in a single pass  
- Achieved **O(n)** time and **O(1)** space (bounded by character set)
