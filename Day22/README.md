## ✅ Problems Solved
| Problem | LeetCode # | Description |
|:--|:--:|:--|
| [Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/) | #125 | Check whether a string is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases. |

---

## 💡 Concepts Practiced
- Implemented **two-pointer technique** (`start` and `end`)  
- Skipped non-alphanumeric characters using `Character.isLetterOrDigit()`  
- Compared characters in a **case-insensitive** manner  
- Handled edge cases like empty strings and symbols-only strings  
- Achieved **O(n)** time and **O(1)** extra space  
- Strengthened string parsing, filtering, and pointer logic
