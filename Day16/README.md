## ✅ Problems Solved
| Problem | LeetCode # | Description |
|:--|:--:|:--|
| [Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/) | #21 | Merge two sorted linked lists into one sorted list, returning the head of the merged list. |

---

## 💡 Concepts Practiced
- Implemented **recursive merging** of two sorted linked lists  
- Practiced **base case handling** (`null` list scenarios)  
- Strengthened understanding of **linked list traversal & node references**  
- Compared node values recursively to maintain **sorted order**  
- Achieved **O(n + m)** time and **O(n + m)** space (due to recursion stack)  
- Enhanced recursive problem-solving intuition
