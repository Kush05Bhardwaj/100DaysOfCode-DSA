## 💡 Concepts Practiced
- Used **XOR (`^`) operation** to eliminate paired numbers  
- Leveraged key XOR properties:
  - `a ^ a = 0`  
  - `a ^ 0 = a`  
  - XOR is **commutative and associative**  
- Efficiently removed duplicates without extra memory  
- Achieved:
  - **O(n)** time  
  - **O(1)** space  
- Strengthened understanding of **bitwise operations** and zero-cost frequency tracking
