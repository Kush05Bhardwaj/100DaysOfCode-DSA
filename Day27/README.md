## 💡 Concepts Practiced
- Used the **two-pointer technique**, starting from both ends  
- Compared squared values of left & right elements  
- Filled the result array from the **end (largest values first)**  
- Handled negative numbers efficiently  
- Achieved **O(n)** time and **O(n)** space  
- Improved understanding of **sorted transformations** and **pointer movement logic**
