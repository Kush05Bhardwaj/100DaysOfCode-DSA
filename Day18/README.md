## 💡 Concepts Practiced
- Used **HashSet** to store unique elements from the first array  
- Performed **constant-time lookups** to find common elements  
- Avoided duplicates automatically using set properties  
- Practiced **stream conversion** from `Set<Integer>` to `int[]`  
- Achieved **O(n + m)** time and **O(n)** space complexity  
- Strengthened knowledge of **hashing, set operations, and Java streams**
