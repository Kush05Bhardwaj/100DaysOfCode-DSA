## ✅ Problems Solved
| Problem | LeetCode # | Description |
|:--|:--:|:--|
| [Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/) | #242 | Check whether two strings are anagrams of each other — both must contain the same characters with the same frequencies. |

---

## 💡 Concepts Practiced
- Used **frequency counting** via a fixed-size integer array (26 English letters)  
- Practiced **ASCII-based indexing** with `char - 'a'`  
- Ensured **balanced increment-decrement** for each character count  
- Avoided use of extra data structures like `HashMap` for efficiency  
- Achieved **O(n)** time and **O(1)** auxiliary space complexity  
- Strengthened understanding of **string traversal** and **frequency parity**
