## ✅ Problems Solved
| Problem | LeetCode # | Description |
|:--|:--:|:--|
| [Check if All Characters Have Equal Number of Occurrences](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-all-characters-have-equal-number-of-occurrences/) | #1941 | Determine whether all characters in a string occur the same number of times. |

---

## 💡 Concepts Practiced
- Built a **frequency map** using a `HashMap<Character, Integer>`  
- Used `getOrDefault()` to simplify increment logic  
- Compared all character occurrence values to ensure equality  
- Handled edge cases such as single-character or uniform strings  
- Achieved **O(n)** time and **O(1)** space (since only lowercase letters)  
- Strengthened skills in **map traversal**, **frequency comparison**, and **string analysis**
